  <h1>Life: Effect or Cause</h1>
  <small>Posted on <time datetime="2023-27-10">October 27, 2023</time></small>
  <p>
    Work, Work, Work.
    I am an American (like most of the world), and because of this, I have a purpose in life: to work.
  </p>
  <p>
    But in reality, I am told this so that I work towards the goal of making the U.S. dollar worth 2 U.S. dollars, and so that the Iranian Rial is worth half of itself.
    The more mindless workers there are, the better the economy thrives. A mindless worker is the same as a worker to the government. Einstein, Feynman, these are as mindless as the miner in Alaska.
    This begs the argument, if workers are working on the economy, then what is their purpose? Is it physics, maybe it's to sew a pocket onto a coat, or make one crease while the 10-year-old next to you makes the next.
  </p>
  <p>
    To have a purpose would mean that you have an effect, that your consciousness has an effect on something else. But does it really?
    If I am an effect of something, what I do is an effect of my cause. So now, consciousness: a cause or an effect?
  </p>
  <h3>Affect</h3>
  <p>
    Your thinking is a combination of many different emotions. And emotions themselves are also abstractions of chemical reactions, similar to a logic gate but much more important.
    Atoms bounce around a whole bunch to make an illusion that you are conscious. But you are just a bag of effects. Existence is effect, not cause.
  </p>
  <h2>At the end of the day, your life is meaningless. It is just an effect of the past.</h2>
  <h3>I am aware this article is horribly written, you may not understand everything I wished to convey. But that's okay, because it doesn't matter anyway.</h3>
  <p>Idea: Is civilization the worst thing to happen to man? And if man thought of food, life, and sex before organized thought in an organized group, was there consciousness then?</p>
