## Wordle
Today's worlde was a bit tricky, the word is not commonly structured compared to the words of past wordles.

## Mini Crossword
This was really easy today (it's a Monday). 
I originally thought that 9-across was in the present tense. I think this is natural since "float" is the last thing read, but the verb with the tense-to-look-at is "failed".

## Crossword
This wasn't that bad (again, it's a Monday).
My Mom did half on the paper, and I did the rest with her.
I redid it online around 6 hours later and it took me a good amount of time.

## Connections
I showed my mother this and we ended up doing it together.
It was not that hard, however, the trickiest section was very interesting.

## Strands
Strands theme usually disagrees with me; fittingly, I didn't like today's theme.
The theme describes *people* that are "rolling in it".
It should be things you are rolling in, because *it* is the ambigious part of the phrase.
The same complaint stands for the spangram.
This made it more difficult. ~~It makes sense to have difficult themes, though.~~
