This is the first post for the Axel Stahl Blog.

This blog will contain posts made by me (Axel Stahl).
The logs can be a whole bunch of things:
- Technical walkthroughs
- Opinions on Open Source software
- Life (or fictional) stories
- Notes on things
- Attemps at turning thoughts to digestable writing

## Reasons Behind My Blog

There are a many reasons to have a blog -- here are the few reasons I created a blog:

### 1. An Album of My Youth

I remember a relative telling me my memory is great. I also remember my Pre-K teacher telling my class that the ability of our memory shrinks as our age grows.
But some things I don't remember are the names of my classmates, my past friends, books I've read, and all the moments I'll want to look back on.
Instead of relying on my faulty memory, I want a digital, open safe. However, I don't want to remember anything *too* bad, so I'll rely on the lack of anonymity to produce purer writing.

### 2. Sharing Thoughts and Describing Feelings

- I never talk to other people about my feelings and personal thoughts. However, I need to develop some aptness of describing my feelings and thoughts, so I will try to write them down.
- I never liked the perishability of thoughts and ideas. People think all the time, only to forget their thoughts and remove their use. Mine, I'll write them here.

### 3. Eloquence

I am very bad at turning thought into words, spoken or written (even worse at signed). So, writing these blogs will make speaking and writing easier, for me and the intaker.
