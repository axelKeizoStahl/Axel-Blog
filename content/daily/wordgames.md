## Wordle
Not bad. If there was something tricky it was the V (because of it's rarity).
I was suprised to see April excluded from the word list, but it makes sense.

## Mini Crossword
A 6/10 in difficulty.
For some reason, I couldn't think of the work for 4-down. 1-accross was pretty fun, I couldn't get it until 2 of the letters were shown from 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-down.

## Crossword
Workin' on it.

## Connections
Today's was really easy; NYT put today's connections as a 2.7/5.
Again the hardest one was part of a word/phrase.

## Strands
Difficulty: 4/10.
Today's theme keeps with the theme of being really vague.
I should have see the double L's or E's right away and gotten it, but instead I needed a hint. After the hint was smooth sailing.
It's a good feeling when you get the first half of the word, like LINEN.
This was the first vertical spangram in the past couple days.
