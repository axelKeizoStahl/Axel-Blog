        <p>Hello everyone, though, probably, the only one reading this is the github workflow</p>
        <p>Today has been pretty boring so far, I havent been very productive. I did the minimum work for school, just the due stuff. I have a lot of work to do for school, a spanish test is the main issue (I'm horrible at Spanish).</p>
        <p>I felt pretty down today, not really having any willpower to work on stuff. I tried encrypting my existing filesystem a couple times and its making me mad as hell failing so many times.</p>
        <p>I want to install gentoo soon, maybe next weekend (then I can just encrypt at install which is easier). I tried to install gentoo today as well and I couldn't connect to internet (only spent 5 min on it) and then left that.</p>
        <p>Yeah all these failed attempts are getting me depressed I just need to get it right once, whatever I guess I should just study for my Spanish Exam</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>I am also really interested in learning all about systems and going into a lot of depth, its kinda tough since it is such a huge area.</p>

        <p>“An <i>idiot admires complexity</i>, a <i>genius admires simplicity</i>, a physicist tries to make it simple, for an idiot anything the more complicated it is the more he will admire it, if you make something so <b>clusterfucked</b> he can't understand it he's gonna think you're a god cause you made it so complicated nobody can understand it. That's how they write journals in Academics, they try to make it so complicated people think you're a genius” - Terry Davis</p>
